If we just make some changes in the yaml files then we just need to run

e.g I updated the replicas to 3 in deployment.yaml file.

> kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
deployment.apps/first-app-deployment configured

> kubectl get pods
NAME                                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS        AGE
first-app-deployment-647cdcc755-jgwpb   1/1     Running   0               15s
first-app-deployment-647cdcc755-k98tt   1/1     Running   1 (5m23s ago)   20h
first-app-deployment-647cdcc755-qmtlt   1/1     Running   0               15s


for deleteing :

> kubectl delete -f deployment.yaml
deployment.apps "first-app-deployment" deleted

> kubectl get deployments
No resources found in default namespace.


Deleting multiple resources:

> kubectl delete -f deployment.yaml -f service.yaml
service "app-service" deleted
Error from server (NotFound): error when deleting "deployment.yaml": deployments.apps "first-app-deployment" not found
