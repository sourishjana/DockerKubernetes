We can also add labels to deployments and services:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: app-service 
  labels: 
    environment: dev
spec:
  selector: 
    app: first-app-pod
    tier: backend
  ports: 
    - protocol: TCP 
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080 
  type: LoadBalancer

---

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: first-app-deployment
  labels: 
    environment: dev
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector: 
    matchLabels: 
      app: first-app-pod
      tier: backend
  template: 
    metadata:
      labels: 
        app: first-app-pod
        tier: backend
    spec:
      containers: 
      - name: first-app-container
        image: sourishjana/demoimages:v1 



And then we can use them when we want to delete all these deployments services all together:

> kubectl delete -f master-deployment.yaml
service "app-service" deleted
deployment.apps "first-app-deployment" deleted

> kubectl apply -f master-deployment.yaml
service/app-service created
deployment.apps/first-app-deployment created

Here we specified that we want to delete deployments and services with specific label.

> kubectl delete deployments,services -l environment=dev
deployment.apps "first-app-deployment" deleted
service "app-service" deleted
