In order to update deployment:
1. Create a new image with a new tag (Creating image with new tag is IMPORTANT, without that deployment will not get updated)
2. Push to Dockerhub
3. set image cmd to update image in deployment

> docker build -t kub-demo-app .

> docker push sourishjana/demoimages:latest

> kubectl describe deployment first-app

  Containers:
   demoimages:
    Image:         sourishjana/demoimages
    Port:          <none>


Here you can see the container name inside the deployment.
In our case it is demoimages

kubectl set image deployment/deployment_name container_name=dockerhub_image_name

> kubectl set image deployment/first-app demoimages=sourishjana/demoimages

But still it will not work because image must have a new tag to be updated.



CREATE A NEW IMAGE WITH NEW TAG:

> docker build -t kub-demo-app:v1 .

> docker tag kub-demo-app:v1 sourishjana/demoimages:v1

> docker push sourishjana/demoimages:v1

> kubectl set image deployment/first-app demoimages=sourishjana/demoimages:v1
deployment.apps/first-app image updated

> kubectl rollout status deployment/first-app
deployment "first-app" successfully rolled out
