Instead of running long commands we can also use a config file to declare the deployment and run the config file same as docker compose file in docker.

GOTO: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/

for the template

There is a deployment.yaml file here in this directory which you must refer.
You can name the file anything you want just end with .yaml 


deployment.yaml file:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: first-app-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector: # every deployment watches all the pods which are under this deployment
    matchLabels: # in order to specify the pods which will be controlled by the deployment are specified inside this spec
      # this must be same as the labels in the pods
      app: first-app-pod
      tier: backend
  template: # This template always contains details of the POD i.e Kind: Pod
    metadata:
      labels: # a pod can have multiple labels like here we have given 2, you can name it whatever you want.
        app: first-app-pod
        tier: backend
    spec:
      containers: # So we also need to specify the container configurations in the pod
      # now you can have multiple containers in the same pods thats why it is represented by - i.e list 
      - name: first-app-container
        image: sourishjana/demoimages:v1 #image name of dockerhub
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------





> kubectl apply -f=deployment.yaml
deployment.apps/first-app-deployment created

> kubectl get pods
NAME                                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
first-app-deployment-647cdcc755-k98tt   1/1     Running   0          6s

> kubectl get deployments
NAME                   READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
first-app-deployment   1/1     1            1           2m40s




But still after createing a deployment we cannot see our app running as we still havent configured anys ervice
