Now Docker is not only used for web servers and ports and all we can also run normal console ip op applications here using the interactive mode

For example our py file

Build your image:
> docker build . 

Run your image:
You can get the -i for interactive mode and -t to open a termial
> docker run --help

As here we will not be requiring to expose any port we can just do docker run:
> docker run -i -t image_id

If you see the container it is exited after completing the cmd
> docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE          COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS                        PORTS     NAMES

Again if you want to run it once again you can do it using 
-a for attahc mode and -i for interactive mode:

>docker start -a -i container_id
