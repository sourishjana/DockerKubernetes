ADD CONTAINER NAMES:

> docker run --help

> docker run -p 3000:80 -d --rm --name goalsapp c29c00667fa1

> docker ps -a

CONTAINER ID   IMAGE          COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                        PORTS                  NAMES
61ea11f15398   c29c00667fa1   "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   8 seconds ago       Up 8 seconds                  0.0.0.0:3000->80/tcp   goalsapp



ADDING IMAGE NAMES AND TAGS:

In case of images we have name:tag

name here is the image group and tag is a specific version of the image group

e.g 
FROM node

here node is a image name but also we have image tags for this one also

like 
FROM node:14.3.4

to download a specific image

In order to add a name and tag: name:version

> docker build -t goalsappimage:v1 .

F:\Docker\1. docker basic\1 Container details>docker images
REPOSITORY      TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE
goalsappimage   v1        9e8b8cd0cdec   14 seconds ago   1.13GB

Now create an image using the image:

> docker run -p 3000:80 -d --rm --name goalsapp goalsappimage:v1

> docker stop goalsapp
