There are 2 ways you can share you images:

1. Sharing your Docker file with your code ina zip format as done in the course
    In this case you have to run [docker build .] cmd then create containers out of it.
2. Sharing a build image
    In this case we can directly download image and create containers, do not have to build the image.


Pushing Images to a Registry:
there are 2 places where you can push images:

1. Docker Hub -> Free usage possible and is the official docker registry. Public private official images 
2. Private registry -> Any provider you can use like Azure, you have only have you own private images and share it with team.
        Share: docker push image_name
        Use: docker pull image_name


Create a repo in the Docker Hub
Here you will see a cmd -> docker push sourishjana/demoimages:tagname

e.g demoimages

if I want to push any image we have to give a proper name for that like
demoimages/image_name:image_tag

You can name it in 2 ways:
1. When we create a image -> > docker build -t sourishjana/demoimages:v1 .
2. Rename existing image -> > docker tag goalsappimage:v1 sourishjana/demoimages:v1
    In this case we create a replica for existing image


Step1:
> docker login
Authenticating with existing credentials...
Login Succeeded

Step2:
> docker push sourishjana/demoimages:v1
