ATTACHED and DETACHED CONATAINERS:

> docker run -p 3000:80 image_id            -> Attached Conatiner
> docker start container_id                 -> Detached container


Whenever we do [docker run -p 3000:80 image_id] it keeps the cmd open untill you forcefully exit and also print logs if present in our container files 
If we see in server.js file line 41 we have a log statement -> whenever we add any thing in UI we will see the log
So in case of attached containers we can see the log in console


When we run [docker start container_id] we can see just a output and cmd is exited but container is running in the backend.

you can check it using:
> docker ps

stop container using:
> docker stop container_id

WE CAN ALSO CONFIGURE IT:
In order to run a container mode use -d flag and it will not show logs further
> docker run -p 5000:80 -d container_id

In order to change a already running container to attach mode 
> docker attach container_id

Also if your container is not attached then also its fine we can check logs of that conatiner:
> docker logs container_id

If you want to know about more commands:
> docker logs --help


We can attach a container using: -f means follow
> docker logs -f container_id

Starting an already stopped container in attach mode:
> docker start -a container_id
