for the problem we discussed earlier we have to use volumes 

Volumnes are the local host machine storage used inside of the containers in order to solve the problem

> docker volume --help
> docker volume ls


two types of volumes:
1. Anonymous volume
2. Named volume

1. Anonymous volume:

Dockerfile:
FROM node:14

WORKDIR /app

COPY package.json /app

RUN npm install

COPY . /app

EXPOSE 80

VOLUME [ "/app/feedback" ]

CMD [ "node", "server.js" ]


> docker build -t feedbackappimage:v1 .
> docker run -p 3000:80 -d --rm --name feedbackapp feedbackappimage:v1

Add one feedback

> docker volume ls
DRIVER    VOLUME NAME
local     db9466fb735e38967c6445e1bed69886c5acb6eb1d281b71b95d385bfd1d316f


Here we can add one line which tells which part of the container folder should be a volume and should persist across containers.
But in this case we donot know where our files are stored and also we cannot access them also. That is why they are Anonymous volume.

> docker stop feedbackapp

> docker volume ls
DRIVER    VOLUME NAME


Now see if we stop the container then the Anonymous volume also gets removed. But this we donot want. 
So Anonymous volume is attached with a container, and it persist till the container is there.


2. Named volume:

Now remove the volume part from the docker file as it was for anonymous volume

Dockerfile:
FROM node:14

WORKDIR /app

COPY package.json /app

RUN npm install

COPY . /app

EXPOSE 80

CMD [ "node", "server.js" ]


-v volume_name:actual_container_file_storage_location
e.g -v appvolume:/app/feedback

> docker run -p 3000:80 -d --rm --name feedbackapp -v appvolume:/app/feedback feedbackappimage:v1

> docker volume ls        
DRIVER    VOLUME NAME
local     appvolume

> docker stop feedbackapp

Even if you remove the container then also in the below cmd the volume persist now.

> docker volume ls        
DRIVER    VOLUME NAME
local     appvolume

> docker run -p 3000:80 -d --rm --name feedbackapp -v appvolume:/app/feedback feedbackappimage:v1

We try to add 'hello' feedback it says already exists
If we try http://localhost:3000/feedback/hello.txt we can see our file
