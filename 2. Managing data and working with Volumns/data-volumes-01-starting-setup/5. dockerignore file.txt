.dockerignore file is used to ingnore certain files or folders during the COPY instruction

COPY . /app

you can see the dockerignore file for this project


You can add more "to-be-ignored" files and folders to your .dockerignore file.

For example, consider adding the following to entries:

Dockerfile
.git
This would ignore the Dockerfile itself as well as a potentially existing .git folder (if you are using Git in your project).

In general, you want to add anything which isn't required by your application to execute correctly.
