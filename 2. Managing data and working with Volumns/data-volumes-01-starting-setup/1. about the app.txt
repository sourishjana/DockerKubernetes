Create Image:
>docker build -t feedbackappimage:v1 .

Create Container:
>docker run -p 3000:80 -d --rm --name feedbackapp feedbackappimage:v1


When we create a new feedback with a unique title then it will goto feedback folder
When we create a new feedback with a already existing title it will go into the temp folder

So here we have 2 kind of data -> 
1. temporary data -> which we donot care if it gets deleted 
2. We have our permanent data which we need even when our container is not up


When we create a new feedback using the app we can not see it in local machine -> because the file will be created inside the container and there is no relation to our local env as everything is happening inside the container.

goto http://localhost:3000/feedback/hello.txt
to see the file we created.




PROBLEM:

> docker stop feedbackapp
> docker rmi feedbackapp

Now if we stop the container and as we created the container with -rm flg so it will also remove the container also.
In this case we had our file inside the container but removing the container will delete the file also.

NOTE: Stopping and restarting the container will not affect the files as container is still there.

So there is a problem with our data if we need it again.
