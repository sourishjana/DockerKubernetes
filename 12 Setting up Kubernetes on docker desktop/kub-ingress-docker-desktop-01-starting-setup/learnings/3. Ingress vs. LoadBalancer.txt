Ingress vs. LoadBalancer: Which One is Better?
Both Ingress and LoadBalancer services can expose applications outside the Kubernetes cluster, but each has its use case.


1️⃣ When to Use Ingress? (Recommended for Most Cases)
✅ Best for: Managing Multiple Services Efficiently
Ideal when you have multiple services and want to expose them via a single LoadBalancer.
Provides path-based (/api, /user) and domain-based (app.example.com) routing.
Supports TLS (HTTPS) termination, security, and rewrites.


🔥 Why Use Ingress Instead of LoadBalancer?
Feature	            Ingress (Recommended)	                                LoadBalancer
Cost	            ✅ Uses 1 LoadBalancer for all services	            ❌ Each service needs a LoadBalancer ($$$)
Path-Based Routing	✅ /api → API Service /user → User Service	        ❌ No built-in routing
TLS/SSL (HTTPS)	    ✅ Built-in TLS termination	                        ❌ Must configure manually
External Traffic	✅ Exposes multiple services via one IP	            ❌ Each service gets its own IP
Advanced Features	✅ Load balancing, rate limiting, authentication	    ❌ Basic external access only


🚀 Example Use Case: Multiple Microservices
Imagine you have:

A user service (/users)
A task service (/tasks)
With Ingress, you can route traffic to different services using paths:

rules:
  - host: myapp.com
    http:
      paths:
        - path: /users
          backend:
            service:
              name: user-service
              port:
                number: 80
        - path: /tasks
          backend:
            service:
              name: task-service
              port:
                number: 80

🔥 Now, all traffic is handled with ONE LoadBalancer instead of multiple!


🚨 Problems with LoadBalancer
If you have 5 microservices, you’ll need 5 different LoadBalancers (expensive 💸).
No built-in path-based routing like Ingress.
No built-in HTTPS termination, requiring manual setup.
