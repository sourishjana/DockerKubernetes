Now we have added frontend to access the tasks services.

Now its in react and we need some server to serve the react app for that we have used nginx server.
There is s nginx.conf which is a config file.

where there is a part

  # http://service_name.namespace_name:port_on_which_service_exposed/
  location /api/ {
    proxy_pass http://task-service.kubapp:80/;
  }

This is a reverse proxy.

Discussed in next text.

Now still it fails, Why? 

in the network tab it ways 500 internal server error. 
GET http://localhost:8888/api/tasks -> 500 error

now see logs > kubectl logs -l app.kubernetes.io/name=ingress-nginx -n ingress-nginx

this is because of CORS in task-service. we have to allow cross origin requests.

we have to add a code in tasks-api/tasks-app.js

app.use((req, res, next) => {
  res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*');
  res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'POST,GET,OPTIONS');
  res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'Content-Type,Authorization');
  next();
})

again build docker images and push to dockerhub and again update the deployment. It will start working
