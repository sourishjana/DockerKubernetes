As we want to use ingress.

goto: https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/drivers/docker/#known-issues

As of now 8th March 2025 
In the above website its written that:
The ingress, and ingress-dns addons are currently only supported on Linux. See #7332

there is a problem with minikube using ingress
minikube with docker driver does not work with ingress:
> minikube start --driver=docker

So we need to change our kubernetes setup.


We will be using docker-desktop to setup kubernetes cluster.


If you see the current namespaces its only minikube

PS F:\Docker\11. Kubernetes Networking\kub-network-01-starting-setup> kubectl config get-contexts
*         minikube   minikube   minikube   default
