WHY WE USE DOCKER_COMPOSE?

As you can see in the docker-commands.txt file we have all the commands to run mongodb, backend,frontend

All the cmds are super big and annoying to run these long comands. Instead of that we are using docker compose so that we just run docker-compose up -d and everthing is done.






--rm and -d are not used in docker compose beause by default it will be there.

--network goals-net is also not required because container created using docker compose will automatically be in same network.
although you can use your own network

name: composeapp
services:
  mongodb:
    image: 'mongo'
    volumes:
      - data:/data/db
    # environment:
    #   #- MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=max
    #   - MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME: sourish
    #   - MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD: secret
    env_file:
      - ./env/mongo.env
    # networks:
    #   - goals-net
  # backend:
  # frontend:


volumes:
  data:


By default it will run in attached mode:
>docker-compose up 

For Detached mode we have to specify like this
>docker-compose up -d

This will automatically remove all the containers 
> docker-compose down

This will also delete the volumes associated
> docker-compose down -v


In order to get other commands
>docker-compose --help

It will just create images not create containers
> docker-compose build
